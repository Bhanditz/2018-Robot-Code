Code for Team 401's robot for the 2018 *FIRST* Robotics Competition game Power Up.

## General Features:
* Multi-project using [GradleRIO](https://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO) / [EmbeddedTools](https://github.com/JacisNonsense/EmbeddedTools) to allow unified deploys to roboRIO and coprocessor.
* Task tracking and organization using [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/team401/2018-Robot-Code)
* [Bintray releases](https://bintray.com/team401) for software modules.
* Version controlled [IntelliJ Run Configurations](.idea/runConfigurations) to standardize deploy tasks between all programmers.
*  Kotlin used for all robot and coprocessor code



## Robot Features:
*  [Modular domain specific language](https://github.com/team401/SnakeSkin) to make robot code development faster and easier.
*  [State machine based subsystems](robot/src/main/kotlin/org/team401/robot2018/subsystems/Rungs.kt) with optional rejection conditions and entry, exit, and loop behaviors for each state.
*  Motion profiling with [Processing based GUI](https://github.com/team401/MP-Generator) and trajectories generated by [Pathfinder](https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder). 
*  Motion magic controlled [elevator system](robot/src/main/kotlin/org/team401/robot2018/subsystems/Elevator.kt) with manual adjustment
*  Motorized [virtual four bar intake](robot/src/main/kotlin/org/team401/robot2018/subsystems/Intake.kt) with positional PID control to add 'springs' to the system. Current monitoring to detect power cube acquisition.
*  Custom [two-speed 775pro drive](robot/src/main/kotlin/org/team401/robot2018/subsystems/Drivetrain.kt) with autoshifting and anti-tip correction.
*  '[Virtual sensors](robot/src/main/kotlin/org/team401/robot2018/Sensors.kt)' for controlling LEDs and coprocessors.

## Coprocessor Features:
* [SnakeEyes vision library](https://github.com/team401/SnakeEyes) providing custom tiling picture-in-picture multi-camera views, side-by-side views, and targeting crosshairs
* [Automatic recording of match videos](vision/src/main/kotlin/org/team401/vision2018/VideoRecorder.kt) with footage automatically transferred to external storage device.
